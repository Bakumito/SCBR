    <h1>SQL for Data Science</h1>
    <p>
      Describe SQL, Data, database, relational database.
      <br />
      List five basic SQL commands.
    </p>
    <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
    <p>
      SQL is a language used for relational databases, to query or get data out
      of the databases. SQL - Structured English Query Language.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Data?</h2>
    <p>
      Data is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers, or even
      pictures. Data is one of the most critical assets of any business. It is
      used and collected practically everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>What is database?</h2>
    <p>
      A database is a repository of data. It is a program that stores data. A
      database also provides the funcionality for adding, modifying, and
      querying that data. There are different kinds of databases of different
      requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Relational Database?</h2>
    <p>
      The data can be stored in various forms. When data is stored in tabular
      form, the data is organized in tables like in a spreadsheet, which is
      columns and rows. That's a relational database. The columns contain
      properties about the item such as last name, first name, email, address,
      city. A table is a collection of related things like a list of employees
      or a list of book authors. In a relational database, you can form
      relationships between tables.
    </p>
    <h2>What is DBMS or RDBMS?</h2>
    <p>
      A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a database
      management system or DBMS for short. The terms database, database server,
      database system, data server, and database management systems are often
      used interchangeably. For relational databases, it's called a relational
      database management system or RDBMS. RDBMS is a set of software tools that
      controls the data such as acess, organization, and storage. And RDBMS
      serves as the backbone of applications in many industries including
      banking, transportation, health, and so on. Examples of relation database
      management systems, are SQL, Oracle Database, DB2 Warehouse on Cloud, and
      DB2 Express C.
    </p>
    <h2>5 simple statements for databases</h2>
    <p>
      For the majority of people, using a select data from the table, update
      data in the table, delete data from the table. So those are the building
      blocks for SQL for data science.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CREATE - a table</li>
      <li>INSERT - data to populate the table</li>
      <li>SELECT - data from the table</li>
      <li>UPDATE - data in the table</li>
      <li>DELETE - data from the table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These statements fall into two different categories. Data Definition
      Language Statements (DDL) or Data Manipulation Language Statements (DML).
      <br />
      Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define, change or
      drop data.
      <br />
      Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used to read and modify
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>Create Table statement</h2>
    <p>
      In a relational database, the data is organized in tables, like in a
      spreadsheet, which is columns and rows.
      <br />
      Based on the AUTHOR entity as the example of a Book entities, we create
      tables using the entity name. The entity attributes will be the columns of
      the table. In this example, the following data types are used:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        AUTHOR(author_ID: char, lastname: varchar, firstname: varchar, email: varchar, city: carchar, country: char)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Char is a character string of a fixed length. Varchar is a character
      string of a variable lenght. In addition, the author_ID attribute is
      assigned as a <strong>primary key</strong>, so that no duplicate values
      can exist.
      <br />
      The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each
      <strong>tuple</strong> or row in a table.
      <br />
      The author table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement. The CREATE
      TABLE statement is one of the data definition language statements (DDL),
      wich are used to create database objects. Based on the author entity and
      its attributes, this slide shows the CREATE TABLE statement. Note that the
      author_id is the primary key.
