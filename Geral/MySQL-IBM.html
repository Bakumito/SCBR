    <h1>SQL for Data Science</h1>
    <p>
      Describe SQL, Data, database, relational database.
      <br />
      List five basic SQL commands.
    </p>
    <h2>What is SQL?</h2>
    <p>
      SQL is a language used for relational databases, to query or get data out
      of the databases. SQL - Structured English Query Language.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Data?</h2>
    <p>
      Data is a collection of facts in the form of words, numbers, or even
      pictures. Data is one of the most critical assets of any business. It is
      used and collected practically everywhere.
    </p>
    <h2>What is database?</h2>
    <p>
      A database is a repository of data. It is a program that stores data. A
      database also provides the funcionality for adding, modifying, and
      querying that data. There are different kinds of databases of different
      requirements.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a Relational Database?</h2>
    <p>
      The data can be stored in various forms. When data is stored in tabular
      form, the data is organized in tables like in a spreadsheet, which is
      columns and rows. That's a relational database. The columns contain
      properties about the item such as last name, first name, email, address,
      city. A table is a collection of related things like a list of employees
      or a list of book authors. In a relational database, you can form
      relationships between tables.
    </p>
    <h2>What is DBMS or RDBMS?</h2>
    <p>
      A set of software tools for the data in the database is called a database
      management system or DBMS for short. The terms database, database server,
      database system, data server, and database management systems are often
      used interchangeably. For relational databases, it's called a relational
      database management system or RDBMS. RDBMS is a set of software tools that
      controls the data such as acess, organization, and storage. And RDBMS
      serves as the backbone of applications in many industries including
      banking, transportation, health, and so on. Examples of relation database
      management systems, are SQL, Oracle Database, DB2 Warehouse on Cloud, and
      DB2 Express C.
    </p>
    <h2>5 simple statements for databases</h2>
    <p>
      For the majority of people, using a select data from the table, update
      data in the table, delete data from the table. So those are the building
      blocks for SQL for data science.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>CREATE - a table</li>
      <li>INSERT - data to populate the table</li>
      <li>SELECT - data from the table</li>
      <li>UPDATE - data in the table</li>
      <li>DELETE - data from the table</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These statements fall into two different categories. Data Definition
      Language Statements (DDL) or Data Manipulation Language Statements (DML).
      <br />
      Data Definition Language (DDL) statements are used to define, change or
      drop data.
      <br />
      Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are used to read and modify
      data.
    </p>
    <h3></h3>
    <h2>Create Table statement</h2>
    <p>
      In a relational database, the data is organized in tables, like in a
      spreadsheet, which is columns and rows.
      <br />
      Based on the AUTHOR entity as the example of a Book entities, we create
      tables using the entity name. The entity attributes will be the columns of
      the table. In this example, the following data types are used:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        AUTHOR(author_ID: char, lastname: varchar, firstname: varchar, email: varchar, city: carchar, country: char)
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Char is a character string of a fixed length. Varchar is a character
      string of a variable lenght. In addition, the author_ID attribute is
      assigned as a <strong>primary key</strong>, so that no duplicate values
      can exist.
      <br />
      The primary key of a relational table uniquely identifies each
      <strong>tuple</strong> or row in a table.
      <br />
      The author table is created using the CREATE TABLE statement. The CREATE
      TABLE statement is one of the data definition language statements (DDL),
      wich are used to create database objects. Based on the author entity and
      its attributes, this slide shows the CREATE TABLE statement. Note that the
      author_id is the primary key.
    </p>

    <h2>Select statement</h2>
    <p>
      The main purpose of a database management system, is not just to store the
      data but also facilitate retrieval of the data. So, after creating a
      relational database table and inserting data into the table, we want to
      see the data.
      <br />
      To see the data, we use the SELECT statement. The SELECT statement is a
      data manipulation language statement. Data Manipulation Language
      statements or DML statements are used to read and modify data. The SELECT
      statement is called a query, and the output we get from executing this
      query is called a result set or a result table.
      <br />
      In its simplest form, a SELECT statement is select star from table name:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        SELECT *
        FROM nome_tabela
        ;

        SELECT column1, column2, columnN
        FROM nome_tabela
        ;

        SELECT *
        FROM table_name
        WHERE nome_coluna > valor
        ;

        SELECT *
        FROM table_name
        WHERE nome_coluna = 'descrição'
        ;        
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      Relational operations helps us in restricting the result set by allowing
      us to use the clause WHERE. The WHERE clause always requires a predicate.
      A predicate is conditioned evaluates to true, false or unknown.
      <br />
      Predicates are used in the search condition of the WHERE clause.
      <br />
      There are other comparison operators supported by a relational database
      management system:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>equal to</li>
      <li>greater than</li>
      <li>less than</li>
      <li>greater than or equal to</li>
      <li>less than or equal to</li>
      <li>not equal to</li>
    </ul>
    <div>
      <h2>COUNT, DISTINCT, LIMIT</h2>
      <h3>COUNT</h3>
      <p>
        COUNT is a built-in database function that retrieves the number of rows
        that match the query criteria.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          SELECT COUNT *
          FROM nome_tabela
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        To retrieve the number of rows where a specific attribute matches the
        criteria:
      </p>
      <pre>
        SELECT COUNT nome_coluna
        FROM nome_tabela
        WHERE nome_coluna='criterio'_ou_valor
      </pre>
      <h3>DISTINCT</h3>
      <p>DISTINCT is used to remove duplicate values from a result set.</p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          SELECT DISTINCT nome_coluna
          FROM nome_tabela
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        To retrieve a list of unique data that match a criteria, removing all
        duplicate values of the same criteria:
      </p>
      <pre>
          <code>
            SELECT DISTINCT nome_coluna1
            FROM nome_tabela
            WHERE nome_tabela2='criterio'_ou_valor
          </code>
        </pre>
      <h3>LIMIT</h3>
      <p>
        LIMIT is used for restricting the number of rows retrieved from the
        database.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          SELECT *
          FROM nome_tabela
          LIMIT valor_numérico
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        This can be very useful to examine the results set by looking at just a
        few rows instead of retrieving the entire result set wich may be very
        large.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code>
          SELECT nome_coluna1
          FROM nome_tabela
          WHERE nome_coluna2=valor
          LIMIT valor_numérico
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
    <h3>INSERT</h3>
    <p>
      After table is created, the table needs to be populated with data. To
      insert data into a table, we use the INSERT statement.
      <br />
      The INSERT statement, wich is a data manipulation language statement, or
      DML statements, is used to add new rows to a table.
      <br />
      The syntax of the INSERT statement looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        INSERT INTO nome_tabela, nome_coluna, VALUES()
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      In the statement, nome_tabela identifies the table, nome_coluna list
      identifies each column in the table, and the values clause specifies the
      data values to be added to the columns in the table.
      <br />
      An example to add a row with the data for Raul Chong, we insert a row with
      an author underscore ID of A one, the last name is Chong, the first name
      as Raul, the email as RFC@IBM.com, the city is Toronto, and the country as
      CA for Canada. The author table has six columns, so the INSERT statement
      lists the six column names separated by commas, followed by a value for
      each of the columns also separated by commas.
      <br />
      It is important that the number of values provided in the values clause is
      equal to the number of column names specified in the column name list.
      This ensures that each column has a value.
      <br />
      Tables do not need to be populated one row at a time, multiple rows can be
      inserted by specifying each row in the values clause.
      <br />
      In the values clause, each row is separated by a comma.
    </p>
    <h3>UPDATE & DELETE Statements</h3>
    <p>
      After a table is created and populated with data, the data in a table can
      be altered with the UPDATE statement.
      <br />
      The UPDATE statement is one of the data manipulation language or DML
      statements. DML statements are used to read and modify data.
      <br />
      To alter or modify the data in a table, the UPDATE statement is used. The
      syntax of the UPDATE statement looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        UPDATE nome_tabela
        SET nome_coluna=valor
        WHERE condição
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <strong>
        Note that if the WHERE clause is not specified, all the rows in the
        table will be updated.
      </strong>
      <br />
      Sometime later, there might be a need to remove one or more rows from a
      table. The rows are removed with the DELETE statement. The DELETE
      statement is one of the data manipulation language statements used to read
      and modify data. The syntax of the DELETE statement looks like this:
    </p>
    <pre>
      <code>
        DELETE FROM nome_tabela 
        WHERE condição
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      The rows to be removed are specified in the WHERE condition.
      <br />
      <strong>
        Note that if the WHERE clause is not specified, all the rows in the
        table will be removed.
      </strong>
